# Shell completion scripts

checkpointctl offers shell completion scripts for bash, zsh and fish. These completion scripts are generated by `make completions`; do not
edit these files directly. To install them you can run `sudo make install.completions`.

For information about these scripts see `checkpointctl completion --help`.
